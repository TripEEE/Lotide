//This function should take in a sentence( as a string) and then return a count of each of the letters in that sentence.

//use lighthouse in the house as your string

//PSEUDOCODE:
//return an object, numOfLetters
//create an empty object at the top of the function
//we do not want to count spaces, and since an empty string is falsy, we make sure that whatever we add is truthy
//use a for of loop to loop through the joined variable
//if the letter appears in the index, create a key of that index
//however many instances the letter occurs, add 1 to its respective index
